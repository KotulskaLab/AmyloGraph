AmyloGraph is a manually curated database on interactions between
amyloid proteins. It is available as an online database
<http://AmyloGraph.com/>, but its functionalities are also accessible as
this R package. The documentation is also [available
online](https://kotulskalab.github.io/AmyloGraph/articles/definitions.html).

## Run AmyloGraph locally

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("KotulskaLab/AmyloGraph")
# then run AmyloGraph using
library(AmyloGraph)
AmyloGraph()
```
