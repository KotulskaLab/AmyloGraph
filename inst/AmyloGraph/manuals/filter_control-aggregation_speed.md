### Is the interactor affecting the interactee's fibrillization speed?

***

This field contains the information on the kinetics of interactee's fibrillization.

1. **Faster aggregation**: a) the maximum ThT emission observed at the end of the reaction of the interactee and interactor is higher than maximum ThT emission for interactee alone OR b) if the slope of the kinetic curve is steeper OR c) the lag phase is shorter OR d) T50 is lower. This is OR operator, so we need only one of these three things to happen. Make sure that fibrillization still happens. Comment: ThT is not always quantitative, i.e. a higher (or lower) ThT level - under different conditions (e.g. the presence of the interactor) - can be caused by changes to the fibril structure rather than the amount of fibrils.
2. **Slower aggregation**: a) the maximum ThT emission observed at the end of the reaction of the interactee and interactor is lower than maximum ThT emission for interactee alone AND b) the slope of the kinetic curve is less steep) OR c) the lag phase is longer. So we need (a AND b) OR c. Make sure that fibrillization still happens.
3. **No aggregation**: There is no confirmed fibrilization after the interaction.
4. **No effect**: a) The slopes of kinetic curves are visibly similar AND b) the maximum ThT emission is similar AND c) the lag phase is similar.
5. **No information**: There were no kinetic assays.
