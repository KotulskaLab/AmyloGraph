### Is the interactor affecting the interactee's fibrillization speed?

***

This field contains the information on the kinetics of interactee's fibrillization.

We use following operators:
Operator OR is valid for a and b means: I) a, II) b, III) a and b.
Operator AND is valid for a and b only when we have a and b simultaneously.

1. **Faster aggregation**: a) the maximum ThT emission observed at the end of the reaction of the interactee and interactor is higher than maximum ThT emission for interactee alone OR b) the slope of the kinetic curve is steeper OR c) the lag phase is shorter OR d) T50 is lower. The fibrillization still occurred.
2. **Slower aggregation**: a) the maximum ThT emission observed at the end of the reaction of the interactee and interactor is lower than maximum ThT emission for interactee alone AND b) the slope of the kinetic curve is less steep OR c) the lag phase is longer. The fibrillization still occurred.
3. **No aggregation**: there is no confirmed fibrilization after the interaction.
4. **No effect**: a) the slopes of kinetic curves are visibly similar AND b) the maximum ThT emission is similar AND c) the lag phase is similar.
5. **No information**: there were no kinetic assays.
