### Physical binding between interactee and interactor.

***

This field contains the information on the interactee's elongation.

1. **Yes, direct evidence**: there is an experimental evidence that fibrils consist of two different amyloids (labeling; immunolabeling; visible colocalization of an interactee and an interactor visible in the microscopic images).
2. **Yes, implied by kinetics**: if seeding is implied by kinetic experiments results and as such it is interpreted by authors of the publication. In principle, this answer covers every acceleration of the fibrillization confirmed by kinetic experiments.
3. **No**: no effect on the elongation of interactee’s fibrils.
4. **Formation of fibrils by the interactee is inhibited**: the formation of interactee’s aggregates was slowed or completely halted by the interactor.
5. **No information**: there is no experimental evidence and seeding is not implied by kinetics experiments results.
