### Presence of the heterogenous fibrils consisting of interactor and interactee molecules.

***

This field contains information on heterogeneous fibrils consisting of interactor and interactee molecules.

1. **Yes**: applies when a) there is experimental evidence that fibrils consist of two different amyloids and b) the mature fibrils are structurally different than fibrils formed in the presence of interactor or c) the term co-aggregation/ heterogeneous fibrils/ hybrid fibrils was used by authors to describe the aggregation process.
2. **No**: the one of the following occurred: a) the resulting amyloid fibrils are confirmed by a microscopy technique to have the same structure as fibrils formed by the interactee without the presence of the interactor or b) there is no fibrillar product at all or c) an interactee and an interactor are the same protein.
3. **No information**: there is no experimental evidence and seeding is not implied by kinetics experiments results.
