### Presence of the heterogenous fibrils consisting of interactor and interactee molecules.

***

This field contains information on heterogeneous fibrils consisting of interactor and interactee molecules.

1. **Yes**: this answer applies when a) there is experimental evidence that fibrils consist of two different amyloids (labeling; immunolabeling) AND b) the mature fibrils are structurally different than fibrils formed in the presence of interactor c) the term co-aggregation/ heterogeneous fibrils/ hybrid fibrils is used to describe the aggregation process.
2. **No**: if the resulting amyloid fibrils have the dimension matching that of the aggregating interactee alone. a) the mature fibrils are confirmed to have the same structure (e.g. TEM) as fibrils formed by the interactee without the presence of the interactor OR b) there is no fibrillar product at all OR c) an interactee and an interactor are the same protein.
3. **No information**: there was a fibrillar product and an interactee and an interactor are different proteins but there was no information on fibrils structure and composition.
