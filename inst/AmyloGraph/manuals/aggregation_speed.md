### Is the interactor affecting the interactee's fibrillization speed?

***

This field contains the information on the kinetics of interactee's fibrillization.

1. **Faster aggregation**: the one of the following occurred: a) the maximum ThT emission observed at the end of the reaction of the interactee and interactor is higher than maximum ThT emission for interactee alone or b) the slope of the kinetic curve is steeper or c) the lag phase is shorter or d) T<sub>50</sub> (the time required for the amyloid reaction to reach 50% of the final fluorescence intensity) is lower. The fibrillization still occurred.
2. **Slower aggregation**: a) the maximum ThT emission observed at the end of the reaction of the interactee and interactor is lower than maximum ThT emission for interactee alone and b) the slope of the kinetic curve is less steep or c) the lag phase is longer. The fibrillization still occurred.
3. **No aggregation**: there is no confirmed fibrilization after the interaction.
4. **No effect**: a) the slopes of kinetic curves are visibly similar and b) the maximum ThT emission is similar and c) the lag phase is similar.
5. **No information**: there were no kinetic assays.
