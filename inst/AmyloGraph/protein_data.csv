"Bri2","This record leads to Integral membrane protein 2B (Bri2), however in publications we often enounter only the BRICHOS domain, that occurs not only in Bri2, but also in other proteins, like P11686. If the authors clearly state, that they focus on the other posible source of the BRICHOS domain, do not use Bri2","Q9Y287"
