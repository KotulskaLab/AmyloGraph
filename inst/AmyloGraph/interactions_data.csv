The lag-times are almost identical for both peptides at 7.5 hours whilst the apparent elongation rates kapp are also very similar; 0.15 and 0.17 (± 0.02) hrs-1 for Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(11-40) respectively. This strongly suggests that, in the case of Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(11-40), the fibres largely co-fibrillise.","In mixtures of Abeta(11-40)/(1-40), only short rod-like fibres are observed, similar in length to Abeta(11-40) in isolation, figure 2a. If Abeta(11-40) and Abeta(1-40) form fibres independently one would expect very long fibres to also be present, as is observed for Abeta(1-40) in isolation. Quantification of fibre length distribution, (figure 2a) indicates only very short fibres (<400 nm) are consistently present. Incorporation of Abeta(11-40) into Abeta(1-40) fibres imparts these fibres with a similar susceptibility to sheer forces as isolated Abeta(11-40)","Interactor: Abeta (1-40) Interactee: Abeta (11-40)

The presence of lysozyme monomers reduced the t50 value, similarly as 2 µM LF, however, they did not cause such an increase in ThT fluorescence intensity or changes to insulin fibril secondary structure (Supplementary Material Figure S7) as was the case with 200 µM LF. As lysozyme fibrils appeared to have an effect on nucleation, as well as the aggregation curve slope value (possible faster rate of elongation), seeded aggregation experiments were carried out in the absence or presence of 2 µM or 200 µM LF (Figure 4, Supplementary Material Figure S8). When seeded aggregation occurred in the AC solution without any lysozyme fibrils, we observed typical seed-concentration-dependent kinetics (Figure 4A). The same was true when there was 2 µM of LF added to the solution (Figure 4B). In both cases, the overall ThT fluorescence intensity remained relatively low, however, there was a slightly higher end-point intensity when there was a large concentration of insulin seed added (Figure 4A,B,F). The average t50 values of samples without LF were higher throughout the entire seed concentration range when compared to the 2 µM LF samples, and both followed a linear trend, which converged at higher seed concentrations (Figure 4E). The slope values were also slightly higher in the case of 2 µM LF, which was observed in the spontaneous aggregation experiment as well (Figure 1E).",NA,"Seeing as the presence of LF had such a significant effect on insulin fibril formation, and the ThT fluorescence intensity hints at the formation of a different aggregate conformation, atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were acquired to examine if there were any changes to fibril morphology. When there was a small concentration of LF added to the sample, there were no significant changes observed (Figure 2A,C), and average fibril height and width remained even (5 nm and 27 nm, respectively). When 200 µM of LF was present, it became extremely difficult to differentiate between insulin and lysozyme fibrils, as thereInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 1775 4 of 11 was a high propensity towards cluster formation (Figure 2B,D). One aspect worth noting was that when insulin was aggregated with 200 µM LF, the clusters were significantly more massive than in the control LF samples (Figure 2B,D). Due to such cluster formation, it was impossible to draw any conclusions about the effect LF had on insulin fibril morphology (single fibril width, height, and length could not be accurately measured), which requires an alternative method to determine whether there were any LF-induced structural changes",NA,"10.3390/ijms22041775","AG00114"

Interestingly, filamentous aggregates of alpha-synuclein seeded tau aggregation more effectively than alpha- synuclein monomers (Figure 4b,c).

In the overlaid HSQC NMR spectra, notable changes in the chemical shift were observed for numerous residues upon additions of tau monomers. The chemical shift perturbations are more pronounced in the C-terminal region of alpha-synuclein (Figure 7b). The Nterminal regions (15−63) are also slightly affected, while the nonamyloid-beta component (NAC) region (65−95) remains nearly unchanged. The titration NMR experiments indicate that tau affects both N-terminal as well as C-terminal regions of alpha-synuclein. The addition of tau also causes the NMR signal to decrease in intensity for the residues undergoing chemical shift changes (Figure S12). However, the decreases in the NMR signal intensity is observed only for the C-terminal region (110−140) of alpha-synuclein (Figure S12).

The weight-normalized ThT signal produced by aliquots of this reaction correspondingly rise rapidly in the initial 24 hours, reaching a plateau within 60 hrs to a relatively high yield of ThT fluorescence of ~ 2.2 x 105 fluorescence units per µg (Fig. 1a, ○). The steady increase in weightnormalized ThT signal over the first 24 hrs suggests a transition through one or more intermediates with steadily increasing levels of ThT-sensitive beta-structure. Further detail is provided by EM (Fig. 2) and DLS (Fig. 3) analyses of reaction time points. After 1 hr, when 10% of the Abeta42 molecules have already been converted to sedimentable aggregates (Fig. 1a, ●), DLS reveals a broad distribution of particles centered at ~ 10 nm in hydrodynamic radius (Fig. 3b), and this is consistent with EM images showing lightly staining particles in the same size range (Fig. 2a).

This observation indicates that the fibrils formed from Abeta5−42 monomers, in the presence of 0.1% or more of Abeta42 seeds, differ significantly from those formed from pure Abeta5−42 monomer. Fits using different models trying to describe this behavior are shown in Supporting Information Figures S7 and S8. The fact that the slope of the aggregation curves increases continuously as the seed concentration is increased, as reflected by the increase in k2 when fitted to the curves individually (Figure S8), implies that the Abeta42 seeds induce the formation of a new type of Abeta5−42 fibrils, which are not formed directly from Abeta5−42 monomers and have a higher propensity to self-replicate.",NA,"Abeta (5–42) seeds 0,3%-10% / 2 μM Abeta (5–42) monomer Seeds = preformed fibrils","10.1021/acschemneuro.8b00676","AG00373"

of FapC monomers and fibrils could reduce mutual A𝛽–A𝛽 interactions to slow down the peptide fibrillization. Specifically, the
fibrillization rate constant (k) of A𝛽 was markedly increased from
0.7 to 1.6 h−1 in the presence of FapCS (Figure 1B), while the
lag time of A𝛽 was essentially abolished and the fibrillization
half-life was decreased by 86% (Figure 1C,D). Static light scattering (SLS) also reflected a significantly more rapid A𝛽 fibrillar
growth when incubated with FapCS (Figure 1E).","Our simulations demonstrated that FapC had several A𝛽-
binding hotspots scattered along the protein sequence, among
which only FapC41-50 was amyloidogenic to allow incorporation
of A𝛽 into the corresponding nanofibril, i.e., seeding the fibrillization of A𝛽. These results were consistent with the experimental observation that a fraction of FapCS was incorporated into
A𝛽 fibrils while other FapCS adsorbed to the sides of A𝛽 fibrils.
Together, our computational and experimental results suggested
that the exposed surfaces of FapCS upon sonication were likely
heterogeneous and only a subset of FapCS with the “seedingcompetent” hotspots exposed could nucleate the formation of A𝛽
fibrils, while the rest bound to A𝛽 via other hotspot sequences.","Our simulations demonstrated that FapC had several A𝛽-

ten independent simulations A𝛽 stayed on the lateral surface of
the FapC nanofibril. As a result, the probability distribution of
center-of-mass (COM) distances between the A𝛽 monomers and
the FapC41-50 nanofibril featured three peaks (Figure 2D), where
the highest peak corresponded to binding of the peptide at the
two nanofibril ends.","FapC seeds (FapCS) propagated their structural characteristics

The coincubation of hIAPP and rIAPP also decreases cell viability, presumably due to the formation of more toxic hybrid oligomers at the prolonged lag phase. Comparative MD simulations confirm that the crosssequence interactions between hIAPP and rIAPP stabilize beta-sheet structure and thus likely promote their fibrillization.

In the presence of Abeta40 [1:1 (mol/mol) ratio, 40 μM total peptide concentration, and 2% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)], no difference in the rate of fluorescence decrease was observed, indicating that the presence of Abeta40 has no effect on Abeta16–22 aggregation (Fig. 2C).","Sedimentation of the mixed system by centrifugation after 1 hour demonstrated that Abeta40 was present mainly in the supernatant (Fig. 2, D and E). These results demonstrate that Abeta16–22 aggregates rapidly to form amyloid-like fibrils, while Abeta40 remains soluble as monomers/oligomers. Thus, although the rate of Abeta40 aggregation is increased by the presence of Abeta16–22, limited or no co-assembly between the two peptides into fibrils was observed. By contrast, Abeta16–22 aggregation is unaffected by the presence of Abeta40.","Sedimentation of the mixed system by centrifugation after 1 hour demonstrated that Abeta40 was present mainly in the supernatant (Fig. 2, D and E). These results demonstrate that Abeta16–22 aggregates rapidly to form amyloid-like fibrils, while Abeta40 remains soluble as monomers/oligomers. Thus, although the rate of Abeta40 aggregation is increased by the presence of Abeta16–22, limited or no co-assembly between the two peptides into fibrils was observed.

Abeta-(16-22) aggregates more rapidly than Abeta-40
As the assembly kinetics of Abeta16–22 could not be measured using any of the amyloid dyes surveyed at the concentrations used here, a fluorescence quenching assay was developed to determine whether Abeta16–22 aggregates more or less rapidly than Abeta40. For these assays, Abeta16–22 N-terminally labeled with tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) was synthesized, including a 6-aminohexanoic acid linker (Ahx) to limit disruption to the native fibril structure that might arise due to the bulky fluorophore.","10.1126/sciadv.aav8216","AG00778"
