are shifted downfield for the Aß(11-40) peptide at pH 7.4, as shown
in figure 3A. [...] The NMR experiment enables monitoring fibre growth of Aß(11-40) and Aß(1-40) independently from within an equimolar mixture. The lag-times are almost identical for both peptides at 7.5 hours whilst the apparent elongation rates kapp are also very similar; 0.15 and 0.17 (± 0.02) hrs-1 for Aß(1-40) and Aß(11-40) respectively. This strongly suggests that, in the case of Aß(1-40) and Aß(11-40), the fibres largely co-fibrillise.","Yes","In mixtures of Aß(11-40)/(1-40), only short rod-like fibres are observed, similar in length to Aß(11-40) in isolation, figure 2a. If Aß(11-40) and Aß(1-40) form fibres independently one would expect very long fibres to also be present, as is observed for Aß(1-40) in isolation. Quantification of fibre length distribution, (figure 2a) indicates only very short fibres (<400 nm) are consistently present. Incorporation of Aß(11-40) into Aß(1-40) fibres imparts these fibres with a similar susceptibility to sheer forces as isolated Aß(11-40)","Interactor: Aß (1-40) Interactee: Aß (11-40)

The presence of lysozyme monomers reduced the t50 value, similarly as 2 µM LF, however, they did not cause such an increase in ThT fluorescence intensity or changes to insulin fibril secondary structure (Supplementary Material Figure S7) as was the case with 200 µM LF. As lysozyme fibrils appeared to have an effect on nucleation, as well as the aggregation curve slope value (possible faster rate of elongation), seeded aggregation experiments were carried out in the absence or presence of 2 µM or 200 µM LF (Figure 4, Supplementary Material Figure S8). When seeded aggregation occurred in the AC solution without any lysozyme fibrils, we observed typical seed-concentration-dependent kinetics (Figure 4A). The same was true when there was 2 µM of LF added to the solution (Figure 4B). In both cases, the overall ThT fluorescence intensity remained relatively low, however, there was a slightly higher end-point intensity when there was a large concentration of insulin seed added (Figure 4A,B,F). The average t50 values of samples without LF were higher throughout the entire seed concentration range when compared to the 2 µM LF samples, and both followed a linear trend, which converged at higher seed concentrations (Figure 4E). The slope values were also slightly higher in the case of 2 µM LF, which was observed in the spontaneous aggregation experiment as well (Figure 1E).","Yes; implied by kinetics.",NA,"No information","Seeing as the presence of LF had such a significant effect on insulin fibril formation, and the ThT fluorescence intensity hints at the formation of a different aggregate conformation, atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were acquired to examine if there were any changes to fibril morphology. When there was a small concentration of LF added to the sample, there were no significant changes observed (Figure 2A,C), and average fibril height and width remained even (5 nm and 27 nm, respectively). When 200 µM of LF was present, it became extremely difficult to differentiate between insulin and lysozyme fibrils, as thereInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 1775 4 of 11 was a high propensity towards cluster formation (Figure 2B,D). One aspect worth noting was that when insulin was aggregated with 200 µM LF, the clusters were significantly more massive than in the control LF samples (Figure 2B,D). Due to such cluster formation, it was impossible to draw any conclusions about the effect LF had on insulin fibril morphology (single fibril width, height, and length could not be accurately measured), which requires an alternative method to determine whether there were any LF-induced structural changes",NA,"10.3390/ijms22041775","AG00114"

Interestingly, filamentous aggregates of <U+03B1>-synuclein seeded tau aggregation more effectively than <U+03B1>- synuclein monomers (Figure 4b,c).

Most notably, the slope of the aggregation curves, determined by the elongation and secondary nucleation rates of the growing fibrils, increases with increasing Aß42 seed amount. This observation indicates that the fibrils formed from Aß5-42 monomers, in the presence of 0.1% or more of Aß42 seeds, differ significantly from those formed from pure Aß5-42 monomer. Fits using different models trying to describe this behavior are shown in Supporting Information Figures S7 and S8. The fact that the slope of the aggregation curves increases continuously as the seed concentration is increased, as reflected by the increase in k2 when fitted to the curves individually (Figure S8), implies that the Aß42 seeds induce the formation of a new type of Aß5-42 fibrils, which are not formed directly from Aß5-42 monomers and have a higher propensity to self-replicate.","No",NA,"Aß (5–42) seeds 0,3%-10% / 2 µM Aß (5–42) monomer Seeds = preformed fibrils","10.1021/acschemneuro.8b00676","AG00373"

of FapC monomers and fibrils could reduce mutual A<U+0001D6FD>–A<U+0001D6FD> interactions to slow down the peptide fibrillization. Specifically, the
fibrillization rate constant (k) of A<U+0001D6FD> was markedly increased from
0.7 to 1.6 h-1 in the presence of FapCS (Figure 1B), while the
lag time of A<U+0001D6FD> was essentially abolished and the fibrillization
half-life was decreased by 86% (Figure 1C,D). Static light scattering (SLS) also reflected a significantly more rapid A<U+0001D6FD> fibrillar
growth when incubated with FapCS (Figure 1E).","Yes, direct evidence.","Our simulations demonstrated that FapC had several A<U+0001D6FD>-

of A<U+0001D6FD> into the corresponding nanofibril, i.e., seeding the fibrillization of A<U+0001D6FD>. These results were consistent with the experimental observation that a fraction of FapCS was incorporated into
A<U+0001D6FD> fibrils while other FapCS adsorbed to the sides of A<U+0001D6FD> fibrils.
Together, our computational and experimental results suggested
that the exposed surfaces of FapCS upon sonication were likely
heterogeneous and only a subset of FapCS with the “seedingcompetent” hotspots exposed could nucleate the formation of A<U+0001D6FD>

the FapC nanofibril. As a result, the probability distribution of
center-of-mass (COM) distances between the A<U+0001D6FD> monomers and
the FapC41-50 nanofibril featured three peaks (Figure 2D), where
the highest peak corresponded to binding of the peptide at the

The coincubation of hIAPP and rIAPP also decreases cell viability, presumably due to the formation of more toxic hybrid oligomers at the prolonged lag phase. Comparative MD simulations confirm that the crosssequence interactions between hIAPP and rIAPP stabilize ß-sheet structure and thus likely promote their fibrillization.

In the presence of Aß40 [1:1 (mol/mol) ratio, 40 µM total peptide concentration, and 2% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)], no difference in the rate of fluorescence decrease was observed, indicating that the presence of Aß40 has no effect on Aß16–22 aggregation (Fig. 2C).","No","Sedimentation of the mixed system by centrifugation after 1 hour demonstrated that Aß40 was present mainly in the supernatant (Fig. 2, D and E).

Thus, although the rate of Aß40 aggregation is increased by the presence of Aß16–22, limited or no co-assembly between the two peptides into fibrils was observed.

As the assembly kinetics of Aß16–22 could not be measured using any of the amyloid dyes surveyed at the concentrations used here, a fluorescence quenching assay was developed to determine whether Aß16–22 aggregates more or less rapidly than Aß40. For these assays, Aß16–22 N-terminally labeled with tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) was synthesized, including a 6-aminohexanoic acid linker (Ahx) to limit disruption to the native fibril structure that might arise due to the bulky fluorophore.","10.1126/sciadv.aav8216","AG00778"
