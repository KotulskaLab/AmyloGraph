<li>An <strong>interactee</strong> is always acted upon by an
<strong>interactor</strong>. This is the AmyloGraph terminology and it
is not used in analyzed manuscripts. Suppose the publication uses words
like ‘co-incubation’ and from the text itself it is not clear how to
distinguish between interactor and interactor. Additionally, the authors
study the effect of Protein A on Protein B and vice versa. In this case,
we annotate it as two separate interactions: I) A is an interactor over
B and II) B is an interactor over A.</li>

<h3 id="general-interaction-scenarios">General interaction scenarios<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#general-interaction-scenarios"></a>
</h3>
<p><img src="figures/interaction-scenarios.png"></p>
<p>We assume that six main scenarios can occur during the interaction of
two amyloid proteins (see the figure above). Scenarios depend on the
stability (permanent/transient) of the binding between interactor and
interactee and the impact on the interactee’s fibrillization speed
(acceleration/inhibition). If there is no interaction between interactor
and interactee, amyloid proteins are forming fibrils independently -
scenario I occurs. If there is transient contact between interactor and
interactee along with fibrillation inhibition - scenario II takes place,
but if interactee’s fibrillation is accelerated - scenario IV. If the
physical binding between interactor and interactee occurs together with
fibrillation inhibition - scenario III happens, but if interactee’s
fibrillation is accelerated - scenario V or VI takes place.</p>
<p>scenario I: no interaction between interactor and interactee &amp;
amyloid proteins are forming fibrils independently scenario II:
transient contact between interactor and interactee &amp; inhibition of
homofibril fibrillization scenario III: physical binding between
interactor and interactee &amp; inhibition of homofibril fibrillization
scenario IV: transient contact between interactor and interactee &amp;
acceleration of homofibril fibrillization scenario V: physical binding
between interactor and interactee &amp; acceleration of homofibril
fibrillization scenario VI: physical binding between interactor and
interactee &amp; acceleration of heterofibril fibrillization</p>
<p>The scenarios are discrete but they represent points in the continuum
rather than the real phenomenons. We are aware that depending on the
experimental conditions an interaction can vary between scenario III and
IV. Therefore, we do not imply that each interaction follows strictly
one of these scenarios, but rather presents most dominantly one of them.
To distinguish between these interaction scenarios we design three
descriptors (described below). Descriptor 1. differentiates between
scenarios I (no effect on kinetics) II and III (inhibited aggregation)
as well as IV, V and VI (acceleration). Descriptor 2. discriminates
between scenarios IV and V/VI. Descriptor 3. differentiates between
scenarios V and VI.</p>
<p>For example, if descriptor 1 is <strong>faster aggregation</strong>,
descriptor 2 - <strong>yes, direct evidence</strong> and descriptor 3 -
<strong>yes</strong>, <strong>no</strong> or <strong>no
information</strong>, they describe cross-seeding.</p>

</h4>
<p><strong><em>General remarks:</em></strong> this descriptor is fully
based on the kinetics or any kinetic data. Here, by fibrillization we
mean aggregation from low-organisation levels to mature fibrils
confirmed by e.g., microscopy images. If the interactor accelerates the
speed of the oligomer formation, but they never aggregate into the level
of mature fibrils (fibrillization does not occur), it is not an
acceleration as we understand it. The commonly used technique to measure
the kinetics of fibrillization is Thioflavin T (ThT) assay (e.g., <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/13506129.2017.1304905" class="external-link">ThT 101: a primer
on the use of thioflavin T to investigate amyloid formation (doi:
10.1080/13506129.2017.1304905)</a>). We are aware of the fact ThT is not
always quantitative, i.e. a higher (or lower) ThT level - under
different conditions (e.g., the presence of the interactor) - can be
caused by changes to the fibril structure rather than the amount of
fibrils. For the purpose of simplification, we ignore it and always
follow the interpretation of authors.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>
<strong>Faster aggregation</strong>: a) the maximum ThT emission
observed at the end of the reaction of the interactee and interactor is
higher than maximum ThT emission for interactee alone OR b) if the slope
of the kinetic curve is steeper OR c) the lag phase is shorter OR d) T50
is lower. The fibrillization still occurred.</li>
<li>
<strong>Slower aggregation</strong>: a) the maximum ThT emission
observed at the end of the reaction of the interactee and interactor is
lower than maximum ThT emission for interactee alone AND b) the slope of
the kinetic curve is less steep) OR c) the lag phase is longer. So we
need (a AND b) OR c. The fibrillization still occurred.</li>
<li>
<strong>No aggregation</strong>: there is no confirmed fibrilization
after the interaction.</li>
<li>
<strong>No effect</strong>: a) The slopes of kinetic curves are
visibly similar AND b) the maximum ThT emission is similar AND c) the
lag phase is similar.</li>

<strong>No information</strong>: there were no kinetic assays.</li>

of amyloid proteins</a> considered by us. Every protein on the list has
confirmed amyloid-like properties.</p>
<p><strong>Sequence:</strong> The sequence is a vector of amino
acids.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In the case when the exact sequence is not known, we provide the
longest possible precursor from UniProt.</li>
<li>If protein is available only in a complex or was isolated (for
example, purified from isolated spleen amyloid fibrils), we consider
sequence as unavailable.</li>
<li>If interactee or interactor are mutants/fragments of an amyloid
protein, we provide only the sequence of the mutant/fragment and not the
wild type protein.</li>
<li>We consider sequences that have modified amino acids (e.g.,
methylated), but we do not include this information in the

<li>We do NOT consider mutants that instead of standard amino acids have
a) non-biogenic amino acids (e.g., tyramine) b) non-amino acid

this information in the sequential data.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Source sequence:</strong> the UniProt ID of the original
protein.</p>
<p>The AmyloGraph database as a single protein treats a protein that can
occur in many taxonomic variants or after modifications (e.g., we have
human and bovine precursor albumins, <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P02768" class="external-link">P02768</a> and <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P02769" class="external-link">P02769</a> as well as the
products of the post-translational modifications, <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q56G89" class="external-link">Q56G89</a>).</p>
<p>The source sequence may be not identical to the interactor’s or
interactee’s sequence. However, interactor or interactee might be a part
of the source sequence (as human amyloid beta 1-40 is a part of the <a href="https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P05067" class="external-link">P05067</a>) or a mutated
variant of a source sequence (when some amino acids are altered compared
to the original sequence). For example, in AmyloGraph database the CsgA
protein can occur as one of 6 variants, including 4 homologues and 2
mutants.</p>

<p>We started our manuscript collection on amyloid-amyloid interactions
by defining the eligibility criteria:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The manuscript has to be published after 2000.</li>
<li>The manuscript has to report directly experimental results (this
excludes review papers and simulations).</li>
<li>The manuscript has to report experiments conducted <em>in

<li>The manuscript has to report interactions leading to fibrillization.

<li>If the interactor accelerates the speed of the oligomer formation,

</ol>
</li>
<li>The manuscript has to report interactions between two amyloid
proteins. The list of amyloid proteins considered by us is available <a href="https://github.com/KotulskaLab/AmyloGraph/blob/main/inst/AmyloGraph/protein_data.csv" class="external-link">here</a>.

<p>We have started our search with the analysis of 24 manuscripts in our
in-house collection of publications. Next, we have expanded our search
by repeatedly adding manuscripts cited by manuscripts in our collection
or referencing manuscripts in our collections. The final collection had
364 manuscripts.</p>
<p>We have curated the information in collected publications using a
two-step procedure: <strong>initial curation</strong> and
<strong>validation</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="initial-curation">Initial curation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#initial-curation"></a>
</h3>
<p>During this procedure, a curator reviewed all interactions described
in the manuscripts and annotated them in the dedicated form considering
three AmyloGraph descriptors: descriptor 1. the impact on the speed of
the fibrillization; descriptor 2. physical binding between interactee
and interactors; descriptor 3. presence of the heterogenous fibrils
(described in detail in the section <a href="https://kotulskalab.github.io/AmyloGraph/articles/definitions.html#descriptors" class="external-link">Descriptors</a>).
They chose names of amyloid proteins involved in the interaction from a
<a href="https://github.com/KotulskaLab/AmyloGraph/blob/main/inst/AmyloGraph/protein_data.csv" class="external-link">list</a>
and collected information on the amyloids’ sequence. Each record was
associated with manuscript’s doi.</p>
<p>The final list of interactions after the initial curation covered 863
interactions 49 proteins described in 185 manuscripts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="validation">Validation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#validation"></a>
</h3>
<p>During this procedure, a curator has independently reviewed the
reported interaction records from assigned manuscripts in the dedicated
form. The semi-random assignment procedure ensured that the curator who
validated a specific record was not involved in its initial
curation.</p>
<p>They reviewed interaction records similarly to during the initial
curation step. A curator considered three AmyloGraph descriptors:

They chose amyloid proteins’ names from a list, collected information on
the sequence of amyloid proteins involved in the interaction, and
provided the sequence of an original protein by its UniProt ID. They
could also add in missing interaction records or remove false ones.</p>
<p>The final list covers 883 interactions between 46 proteins described
in 173 manuscripts.</p>

authors’ of the publication. If somebody authored more then one
manuscript we contacted this author about all of the reported

<p>Data in AmyloGraph can be filtered using an amino acid motif. A motif
that should appear in either interactor’s or interactee’s sequence. Only
interactions between those sequences will be displayed on the graph and
in the table.</p>
<p>A motif should consist of the letters representing amino acids with
possibility of using the following ambiguous letters: * “B” – either “D”
or “N” * “J” – either “I” or “L” * “Z” – either “E” or “Q” * “X” – any
standard amino acid</p>
<p>Additionally, the character “*” may be used for a subsequence of any
(possibly distinct) amino acids of any length. The character “^” may be
used as the first character of a motif to mark the beginning of the
sequence. Similarly, “$” may be used as the last character of a motif to
mark the end of a sequence.</p>
<p>Some exemplary motifs:</p>
<ul>
<li>“A” – any sequence containing “A”</li>
<li>“GLAAALGA” – any sequence containing “GLAAALGA”</li>
<li>“^AAAAA” – any sequence starting with “AAAAA”</li>
<li>“AXXXA” – any sequence containing two “A”s with exactly three amino
acids between them</li>
<li>“A*A” – any sequence containing two “A”s and any number of any amino
