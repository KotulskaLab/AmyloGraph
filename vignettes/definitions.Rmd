# Main assumptions

1. General logic:
    1. Operator OR is valid for a and b means: I) a, II) b, III) a and b
    1. Operator AND is valid for a and b only when we have a and b simultaneously.
2. Authors’ interpretation always supersedes ours.
3. Interactee and interactor
    1. An interactee is always acted upon by an interactor. Suppose the publication uses words like “co-incubation” and from the text itself it is not clear how to distinguish between interactor and interactor. Additionally, the authors study the effect of Protein A on Protein B and vice versa. In this case, create two separate interactions in the questionnaire: A is an interactor over B and B, where B is an interactor over A.
    1. Database contains only interactions between two amyloids. The form already contains a list of appropriate amyloid proteins. If one of the interaction participants is a non-amyloid protein, it should not be included in the database. The only exceptions are: a) non-aggregating homologs of known amyloid proteins b) non-aggregating mutants of amyloid proteins c) non-aggregating fragments of amyloid proteins.
    1. If the interactee or interactor is a) a mutant of an amyloid protein OR b) a fragment of an amyloid protein OR c) a taxonomic variant of an amyloid protein, we still add them to the database under the name of the original protein. However, in this case, be extremely precise with the actual sequence of the interactee/interactor.
If the sequence of the interactor or the interactee contains modified amino acid residues, we do not supply this information in the sequential data. Instead, this information should be present in the general remarks field.
    1. If the sequence of the interactor or the interactee contains (due to modifications) non-amino acids or nonbiogenic amino acids, this interaction is rejected.
4. Interaction
    1. Many questions and definitions employ the term aggregation. For the manuscript curation, we understood aggregation to the level of mature fibril (fibrillization). If the interactor accelerates the speed of the oligomer formation, but they never aggregate into the level of mature fibrils (fibrillization does not occur), it is not an acceleration in our understanding. Therefore, check the resulting kinetics and search for microscopy images (or any similar confirmation of the fibrillization).
    1. In the case of different interactions of the same two amyloids, when these differences stem from the different amyloid formation levels (monomer, oligomer, fiber), pH, concentration, temperature or other conditions, we note this information as an unstructured comment in the general remarks section. Nevertheless, submit these aggregations as two (or more) different aggregations highlighting the different effects.
    1. Seeding means the induction of interactee’s aggregation by adding interactor’s molecules. Therefore, seeding should be considered positive answers for questions Q1 AND (Q2 OR Q3) AND Q4 AND Q5. Seeding does not exclude heterogeneous fibrils (Q6), but cannot imply it.
    1. We focus only on interactions studied in vitro.
    1. We consider only two-party interactions. The database does not contain interactions with more than two participants, and the only exception is when two out of three participants are the same protein in a different aggregation level.
1. We assume that six main scenarios can occur during the interaction of two amyloid proteins (see the figure below). We design the questions to discriminate between these scenarios. Q1 differentiates between scenarios I (no effect on kinetics) II and III (inhibited aggregation) as well as IV, V and VI (acceleration). Q2 discriminates between scenarios IV and V/VI. Q3 discriminate between scenarios V and VI.

# Questions

## Q1. Is the interactor affecting the interactee's aggregating speed?

**_General remarks:_** this question can be fully answered based on the kinetics or any kinetic data. Here, we mean aggregation to the level of mature fibril (fibrillization). If the interactor accelerates the speed of the oligomer formation, but they never aggregate into the level of mature fibrils (fibrillization does not occur), it is not an acceleration as we understand it. Therefore, check the resulting kinetics and search for microscopy images (or any similar confirmation of the fibrillization). If authors state that it is fibrillization, go with their interpretation. 

This question refers only to kinetic assays. If there are no such assays, select **no information**.

Sufficient experimental techniques: 
 - ThT
 - FTIR
 - Congo Red
 - turbidity measurements followed with microscopy (turbidity on its own is not specific towards amyloid fibrils, but rather to all kinds of aggregates)
 - Far-UV CD spectroscopy
